This repository contains a tool to generate Dash Core RPC documentation. It
requires a running `dash-cli` client and puts out the documentation in
Markdown format as used on [dash-docs.github.io](https://github.com/dash-docs/dash-docs/tree/master/_includes/devdoc/dash-core/rpcs).

Run `rpc-docs-helper` to get command line help. Run `rpc-docs-helper generate`
to generate the markdown. Run `pytest` to run the unit tests if you want to work
on the tool itself.
